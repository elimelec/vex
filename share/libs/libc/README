The VEX C library is derived from "newlib". More information about newlib
is available at http://sources.redhat.com/newlib/.

Newlib is a C library intended for use on embedded systems. It is a
conglomeration of several library parts, all under free software licenses
that make them easily usable on embedded products.

Newlib is only available in source form. It can be compiled for a wide
array of processors, and will usually work on any architecture with the
addition of a few low-level routines.

Newlib is maintained by:

Jeff Johnston <jjohnstn@redhat.com> 
Tom Fitzsimmons <fitzsim@redhat.com>

Contributions Newlib thrives on net contributions from people like
you. We're looking for contributions of code, bugfixes, optimizations,
documentation updates, web page improvements, etc. A nice testsuite
to automate the testing of newlib is also needed. Contributions are
currently done by posting patches and ideas to newlib@sources.redhat.com;
check out the mailing list section to find out more.
